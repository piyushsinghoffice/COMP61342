# üìö Comparative Study: Local Features vs CNNs for Object Recognition

This project presents a comparative analysis between traditional computer vision techniques (SIFT + ORB + Bag-of-Visual-Words) and deep learning approaches (CNNs, Improved CNNs, ResNet18) for object recognition on the **Caltech101** and **CIFAR-10** datasets.

## üîç Project Summary

The study aims to evaluate the performance, generalization, and applicability of these models, particularly in the context of **robotic vision systems**. Traditional pipelines using SIFT and ORB are paired with classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. CNN architectures range from basic implementations to pretrained ResNet18 models, incorporating enhancements such as Batch Normalization, SiLU activation, Label Smoothing, and Learning Rate Scheduling.
